The bug is that DELETED is being treated as a property during the
ORs.

First gets set to FALSE, so we start ORing, but all the flags are
zero.

We need to replace the First BOOL with a state machine saying:

   UNSET
   SET_BY_DELETED
   SET_BY_RESIDUE

On UNSET or SET_BY_DELETED, we use =
On SET_BY_RESIDUE,          we use |=
